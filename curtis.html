        <span id="cBig">C</span>urtis Lee Mayfield (June 3, 1942 – December 26, 1999) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer, and one of the most influential musicians behind soul and politically conscious African-American music.<br/><br/>
        The music that surrounded and informed Curtis Mayfield, born 1942, at an early age came via his grandmother’s Travelling Soul Spiritualists’ Church, Gospel music and the rich mother lode that was Chicago’s electric blues scene. A guitar, discovered at age seven in a closet in the small apartment where he lived with his mother and seven siblings, changed everything. <br/>He played some piano but the guitar was different, very personal. &#8220;…like another me&#8221; he said. Mayfield literally transferred his piano knowledge to his new instrument. <br/><br/>Childhood friend, singer Jerry Butler noted: “He used to love playing boogie woogie on the piano and he learned to play that in F sharp which meant he was playing all the black keys. That’s how he came about his unique sound on the guitar because he tuned it that way.” Mayfield used his eccentric open F sharp tuning for the rest of his career. <br/>He also became proficient on bass, drums and saxophones.

    He first achieved success and recognition with <span>The Impressions</span> during the civil rights movement of the late 1950s and 1960s, and later worked as a solo artist. <br/><br/>Born in Chicago, Illinois, Mayfield started his musical career in a gospel choir.<br/> Moving to the North Side, he met Jerry Butler in 1956 at the age of 14, and joined the vocal group The Impressions. As a songwriter, Mayfield became noted as one of the first musicians to bring more prevalent themes of social awareness into soul music.<br/> In 1965, he wrote <span>&#8220;</span>People Get Ready<span>&#8221;</span> for the Impressions, which displayed his more politically charged songwriting. Ranked at no. 24 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, the song received numerous other awards, and was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, as well as being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.
    <br/><br/>
    After leaving the Impressions in 1970 in the pursuit of a solo career, Mayfield released several albums, including the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Super Fly in 1972. The soundtrack was noted for its socially conscious themes, mostly addressing problems surrounding inner city minorities such as crime, poverty and drug abuse. The album was ranked at no. 72 on Rolling Stone's list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
